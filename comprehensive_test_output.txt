Netflix puts you global on day one—190+ countries, massive marketing, and a track record of turning originals into zeitgeist (from House of Cards to Squid Game). 
How they play: fast decisions, data-informed but creator-led; comedy with Amanda Barclay’s team, drama with Kennedy Corrin—execs who champion distinct voices. 
Why Netflix: bigger worldwide footprint than Apple/Amazon, stronger dubbing/launch muscle, and proven franchise building. 
Process/timeline: intro via reps or aligned prodcos; creative meetings; deal terms with Biz Affairs; paper and exclusivity. Typical close: 6–10 weeks; hot packages: 2–4. 
Focus now: globally scalable, character-first IP and event series.

Brandon Riegg is your target. He’s the VP behind Netflix’s nonfiction hits and perks up when proven IP can binge worldwide. Your breakout podcast is the hook, but you’ll need a seasoned doc producer to walk it in—think Raw TV or Campfire—plus a director with locked access to principals and archives. Package a 6-episode arc, signed life rights, a 3–5 minute sizzle, hard podcast metrics, and a clearance/legal memo. With a top shingle making the intro, expect 8–12 weeks for a read; Netflix only pushes 1–2 true-crime series a year. They moved fast on The Tinder Swindler once access was airtight. Position it as a global, cliffhanger-driven investigation—never just a “podcast adaptation”—and lead with your exclusive materials in the first five slides.

Pitch Netflix UK first via a UK production company with a Netflix track record—Anne Mensah’s scripted team is your gateway, then they’ll escalate to US/global.

Package tight: pilot + 6–8 episode arc, series bible with world rules, clear season engine, VFX scope with realistic budget tiers, sustainability plan (it’s climate), initial cast/director targets, and a UK prodco attached (Left Bank Pictures, Broke & Bones, Eleven Film, Quay Street, Moonage).

Positioning: Netflix beats Apple on speed and volume (roughly 3–6 months to decision vs Apple’s 9–18), but expects a bingeable premise with global stakes and a UK POV. Apple is great for “event” limiteds—fewer slots, pricier, slower, and wants A‑list attachments/director upfront.

Avoid going to US Netflix first or walking in without a VFX/scale budget.

Expect 2–4 weeks for first read, 1–2 notes rounds, then escalate. Success = UK team champions it to global, securing series order or paid writers’ room with US co-positioning.

Jinny Howe is your champion here. She’s driving Netflix’s prestige-limited push and just helped steer House of Guinness—big, auteur, awards-ready and star-led. For your package, bring a pilot and tight 6–8 episode bible, an A-list showrunner with limited-series heat, an auteur director or EP, underlying rights, a reputable producer, and your availability window. Fully packaged, expect 8–12 weeks for a decision; if they want a rewrite or polish, add a couple months. Netflix’s global day-and-date and awards muscle suit your lane better than most rivals. Have your reps take it to Jinny Howe or Michael Azzolino in parallel, and include a sharp lookbook, budget band, and target start date—those specifics signal you’re truly ready.

The most reliable path is through a Korean prodco with an active Netflix track record (Studio Dragon, Climax Studio, Siren Pictures, WOW Point) or your rep to Don Kang’s team.

Package for global scale: build a deck in Korean and English with a 2‑sentence hook, 6–8 episode season arc/bible, sizzle (or pilot scene), franchise plan, and hard data from your hit (completion, social lift, export interest). Attach a proven PD/showrunner and at least one globally recognizable talent; clear worldwide rights (music, likeness, format) and include delivery plan (dubs/subs, QC) and budget. Ask for a general first; tailor to “event, genre-defining, bingeable.”

Netflix vs local broadcasters: Netflix moves faster (6–12 months vs Apple’s 12–18), wants fewer episodes, tighter serialization, cost‑plus with global exclusivity; broadcasters optimize for timeslot, 12–16 eps, PPL, domestic ratings.

Don’t approach without global rights or a clear international hook.

With a warm intro and A-list package: meeting in weeks; real shot at series order in 3–9 months. Success = global launch and franchise potential.

You keep the steering wheel by baking it into the deal, not hoping for it later.

- Rights: Option your books but retain sequel/ancillary publishing; secure meaningful consultation or approval on bible, pilot script, lead cast, showrunner, and director. Add reversion if no greenlight in 18–24 months.
- Attachment: Executive Producer credit, guaranteed writers’ room slot (or screenplay draft for film), and the right to pick from a pre-approved showrunner list.
- Process control: Two script passes, set-visit access, post “view-and-comment,” and tie creative approvals to staying on schedule/budget.
- Oversight: Keep production close (LA if possible) to stay involved.

Timeline (typical):
- Pitch to deal: 4–12 weeks
- Development to greenlight: 6–12 months
- Prep: 3–5 months
- Production: Series 4–7 months; Film 2–4 months
- Post and launch: 4–8 months

Total: 12–24 months to premiere.

Molly Harrington is your go-to here. She shepherds original doc series and gravitates to access-driven, high-impact stories—exactly what your exclusive political figure provides. Package with a veteran investigative showrunner and a reputable doc prodco, plus a 3–5 minute sizzle and an editorial/standards plan; with that, you can see a read and decision window in roughly 6–10 weeks. Netflix wins when the subject can travel globally and drop as a binge, as seen with Turning Point: The Bomb and the Cold War. HBO/Max leans auteur, awards-first, often slower and feature-forward; great for prestige, less for fast global reach. If it skews feature, loop Kate Townsend. Insider move: time your teaser to an election milestone and lock exclusivity in writing.

Here’s the short, practical breakdown you can use in a renewal meeting.

Netflix vs Apple – key differences
- Scale and volume: Netflix favors fast decisions and multiple bites at bat; Apple is more boutique—fewer slots, higher-touch.
- Greenlight path: Netflix is data-led and decisive; Apple is notes-heavy and prestige-minded, often slower.
- Global reach: Netflix’s international machine (dubs/subs/placement) is unmatched; Apple offers a premium halo but fewer overall titles to spotlight against.
- Budgets/ownership: Both pay top-tier; Netflix pushes cost discipline and repeatability, Apple often spends up for marquee talent/packaging.
- Marketing: Netflix has massive in-product marketing; Apple invests deeply in craft-forward campaigns for select titles.
- Deal flexibility: Netflix prefers exclusive overalls; Apple is open to bespoke carve‑outs, especially film vs series or genre lanes.

What Netflix values in an overall renewal
- Recent wins on-platform (completion rate, hours viewed, retention) and proof you can deliver consistently.
- A forward pipeline with 2–3 near-greenlight projects and clear casting/packaging.
- Global upside (concepts that travel, adaptable formats, diverse voices).
- Budget discipline and speed to production.
- A collaborative track record with their Creative and Production teams.

Negotiation levers to consider
- Hybrid structure: overall for series + first-look or carve‑outs (features, animation, unscripted).
- Volume or put commitments with timeline SLAs.
- Overhead and staffing guarantees (key execs locked).
- Performance step-ups (bonuses, term extensions).
- Marketing and launch positioning commitments (global day-and-date, promo windows).
