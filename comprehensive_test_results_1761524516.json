Typical close: 6\u201310 weeks; hot packages: 2\u20134. \nFocus now: globally scalable, character-first IP and event series.",

Package a 6-episode arc, signed life rights, a 3\u20135 minute sizzle, hard podcast metrics, and a clearance/legal memo. With a top shingle making the intro, expect 8\u201312 weeks for a read; Netflix only pushes 1\u20132 true-crime series a year. They moved fast on The Tinder Swindler once access was airtight.

Apple is great for \u201cevent\u201d limiteds\u2014fewer slots, pricier, slower, and wants A\u2011list attachments/director upfront.\n\nAvoid going to US Netflix first or walking in without a VFX/scale budget.\n\nExpect 2\u20134 weeks for first read, 1\u20132 notes rounds, then escalate.

Ask for a general first; tailor to \u201cevent, genre-defining, bingeable.\u201d\n\nNetflix vs local broadcasters: Netflix moves faster (6\u201312 months vs Apple\u2019s 12\u201318), wants fewer episodes, tighter serialization, cost\u2011plus with global exclusivity; broadcasters optimize for timeslot, 12\u201316 eps, PPL, domestic ratings.\n\nDon\u2019t approach without global rights or a clear international hook.\n\nWith a warm intro and A-list package: meeting in weeks; real shot at series order in 3\u20139 months.

Package with a veteran investigative showrunner and a reputable doc prodco, plus a 3\u20135 minute sizzle and an editorial/standards plan; with that, you can see a read and decision window in roughly 6\u201310 weeks. Netflix wins when the subject can travel globally and drop as a binge, as seen with Turning Point: The Bomb and the Cold War.
