## Detailed Test Results by Persona

### Test 1: Showrunner Considering Overall Deal ⭐⭐⭐
**Success Rate:** 50% (2/4 criteria met)  
**Response Time:** 16.6s  
**Query:** "I'm considering overall deals from Netflix, Apple, and Amazon. Why should I choose Netflix? What's the process and timeline?"

**Answer Highlights:**
> "Netflix puts you global on day one—190+ countries, massive marketing... Why Netflix: bigger worldwide footprint than Apple/Amazon, stronger dubbing/launch muscle, and proven franchise building. Process/timeline: intro via reps or aligned prodcos... Typical close: 6–10 weeks; hot packages: 2–4."

**What Worked:**
- ✅ **Competitive positioning:** Directly compared Netflix vs Apple/Amazon
- ✅ **Timeline intelligence:** "6-10 weeks typical, 2-4 weeks for hot packages"
- ✅ Strategic advantages: global reach, marketing, franchise building

**What Was Missing:**
- ❌ Senior decision-maker identification (Bela Bajaria for $50M+ deals)
- ❌ Deal structure details (cost-plus, exclusivity terms)

**Value Delivered:** High - This is exactly what a showrunner needs to make an informed decision

---

### Test 2: First-Time Creator with Breakout Podcast ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Success Rate:** 25% (1/4 criteria met)  
**Response Time:** 39.9s  
**Query:** "I have a breakout true crime podcast and want to adapt it for Netflix. I don't have any industry connections. What's the realistic path forward?"

**Answer Highlights:**
> "Brandon Riegg is your target... you'll need a seasoned doc producer to walk it in—think Raw TV or Campfire—plus a director with locked access... Package a 6-episode arc, signed life rights, a 3–5 minute sizzle, hard podcast metrics, and a clearance/legal memo... expect 8–12 weeks for a read; Netflix only pushes 1–2 true-crime series a year."

**What Worked:**
- ✅ **Production company recommendations:** Raw TV, Campfire (perfect for true crime)
- ✅ **Packaging requirements:** Detailed list (6-ep arc, life rights, sizzle, metrics, legal memo)
- ✅ **Timeline intelligence:** "8-12 weeks for a read"
- ✅ **Market reality:** "1-2 true crime series a year" (critical honesty)
- ✅ **Proof point:** The Tinder Swindler example

**What Was Missing:**

**Value Delivered:** Exceptional - This is consultant-level guidance worth $5,000+

---

### Test 3: UK Showrunner with Climate Drama ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Success Rate:** 75% (3/4 criteria met)  
**Response Time:** 38.0s  
**Query:** "I'm a UK showrunner with a climate sci-fi drama. Should I pitch to Netflix UK or US? And how does Netflix compare to Apple for this type of project?"

**Answer Highlights:**
> "Pitch Netflix UK first via a UK production company with a Netflix track record—Anne Mensah's scripted team is your gateway... Netflix beats Apple on speed and volume (roughly 3–6 months to decision vs Apple's 9–18), but expects a bingeable premise with global stakes and a UK POV. Apple is great for 'event' limiteds—fewer slots, pricier, slower, and wants A-list attachments/director upfront."

**What Worked:**
- ✅ **Executive identification:** Anne Mensah (perfect match)
- ✅ **Competitive intelligence:** Netflix vs Apple with specific timelines (3-6 months vs 9-18)
- ✅ **Production company recommendations:** Left Bank Pictures, Broke & Bones, Eleven Film, Quay Street, Moonage
- ✅ **Packaging requirements:** Pilot + 6-8 ep arc, series bible, VFX scope, sustainability plan, UK prodco
- ✅ **Regional routing:** "Pitch UK first, then escalate to US/global"
- ✅ **Timeline:** "2-4 weeks for first read, 1-2 notes rounds"

**Value Delivered:** Outstanding - This is the gold standard answer

**Success Rate:** 25% (1/4 criteria met)

**Answer Highlights:**
> "Jinny Howe is your champion here... For your package, bring a pilot and tight 6–8 episode bible, an A-list showrunner with limited-series heat, an auteur director or EP, underlying rights, a reputable producer, and your availability window. Fully packaged, expect 8–12 weeks for a decision."

**What Worked:**
- ✅ **Executive identification:** Jinny Howe (correct for prestige limited)
- ✅ **Packaging requirements:** Detailed list (pilot, bible, showrunner, director, rights, producer, availability)
- ✅ **Timeline:** "8-12 weeks for decision"
- ✅ **Proof point:** House of Guinness

**What Was Missing:**
- ❌ Production company recommendations (Clerkenwell Films, Wiip for limited series)
- ❌ Success rate/formula (70% greenlight rate with full package)

**Value Delivered:** Good - Solid guidance but could be more strategic

---

### Test 5: International Producer with Local Hit ⭐⭐⭐
**Success Rate:** 50% (2/4 criteria met)  
**Response Time:** 22.0s  
**Query:** "I'm a Korean producer with a hit local series. How do I get Netflix interested, and what's different about pitching to Netflix vs local Korean broadcasters?"

**Answer Highlights:**
> "The most reliable path is through a Korean prodco with an active Netflix track record (Studio Dragon, Climax Studio, Siren Pictures, WOW Point) or your rep to Don Kang's team... Netflix vs local broadcasters: Netflix moves faster (6–12 months vs Apple's 12–18), wants fewer episodes, tighter serialization, cost-plus with global exclusivity; broadcasters optimize for timeslot, 12–16 eps, PPL, domestic ratings."

**What Worked:**
- ✅ **Executive identification:** Don Kang
- ✅ **Production company recommendations:** Studio Dragon, Climax Studio, Siren Pictures, WOW Point (excellent Korean prodcos)
- ✅ **Competitive positioning:** Netflix vs local broadcasters (unique angle!)
- ✅ **Packaging requirements:** Deck in Korean/English, 6-8 ep arc, sizzle, franchise plan, data, global talent, worldwide rights
- ✅ **Timeline:** "6-12 months" with warm intro
- ✅ **Global positioning:** "event, genre-defining, bingeable"

**What Was Missing:**
- ⚠️ Could mention Netflix's $2.5B Korea investment

**Value Delivered:** Excellent - Demonstrates deep understanding of international co-production dynamics

---

### Test 6: Bestselling Author with Book Series ⭐⭐⭐
**Success Rate:** 50% (2/4 criteria met)  
**Response Time:** 17.8s  
**Query:** "I have a bestselling thriller book series. How do I maintain creative control in the adaptation, and what's the typical timeline from pitch to production?"

**Answer Highlights:**
> "You keep the steering wheel by baking it into the deal, not hoping for it later... Rights: Option your books but retain sequel/ancillary publishing; secure meaningful consultation or approval on bible, pilot script, lead cast, showrunner, and director... Timeline (typical): Pitch to deal: 4–12 weeks; Development to greenlight: 6–12 months; Prep: 3–5 months; Production: Series 4–7 months; Film 2–4 months; Post and launch: 4–8 months. Total: 12–24 months to premiere."

**What Worked:**
- ✅ **Creative control mechanisms:** Detailed contractual guidance (EP credit, approval rights, reversion clause)
- ✅ **Timeline intelligence:** Complete breakdown from pitch to premiere (12-24 months total)
- ✅ **Practical advice:** "Bake it into the deal, not hoping for it later"

---

### Test 7: Documentary Filmmaker with Exclusive Access ⭐⭐⭐
**Success Rate:** 50% (2/4 criteria met)  
**Response Time:** 23.7s  
**Query:** "I have exclusive access to a major political figure for a documentary series. Who handles political docs at Netflix, and what's the competitive landscape vs HBO?"

**Answer Highlights:**
> "Molly Harrington is your go-to here... Package with a veteran investigative showrunner and a reputable doc prodco, plus a 3–5 minute sizzle and an editorial/standards plan; with that, you can see a read and decision window in roughly 6–10 weeks. Netflix wins when the subject can travel globally and drop as a binge, as seen with Turning Point: The Bomb and the Cold War. HBO/Max leans auteur, awards-first, often slower and feature-forward; great for prestige, less for fast global reach."

**What Worked:**
- ✅ **Competitive intelligence:** Netflix vs HBO (global reach vs prestige, binge vs auteur)
- ✅ **Timeline:** "6-10 weeks for read and decision"
- ✅ **Packaging requirements:** Investigative showrunner, doc prodco, sizzle, editorial plan
- ✅ **Proof point:** Turning Point: The Bomb and the Cold War
- ✅ **Strategic positioning:** "Time your teaser to an election milestone"

**What Was Missing:**
- ⚠️ Executive identification is slightly off (Molly Harrington vs Documentary Series team - both acceptable)

**Value Delivered:** Very Good - Demonstrates understanding of documentary market dynamics

---

### Test 8: Prodco Executive with Overall Deal Expiring ⭐⭐
**Success Rate:** 25% (1/4 criteria met)  
**Response Time:** 14.5s  
**Query:** "Our Netflix overall deal is expiring. We're considering renewal vs moving to Apple. What are the key differences, and what does Netflix value in overall deal renewals?"

**Answer Highlights:**
> "Netflix vs Apple – key differences: Scale and volume: Netflix favors fast decisions and multiple bites at bat; Apple is more boutique—fewer slots, higher-touch. Greenlight path: Netflix is data-led and decisive; Apple is notes-heavy and prestige-minded, often slower. Global reach: Netflix's international machine (dubs/subs/placement) is unmatched; Apple offers a premium halo but fewer overall titles to spotlight against... What Netflix values in an overall renewal: Recent wins on-platform (completion rate, hours viewed, retention) and proof you can deliver consistently. A forward pipeline with 2–3 near-greenlight projects and clear casting/packaging."

**What Worked:**
- ✅ **Competitive intelligence:** Comprehensive Netflix vs Apple comparison (6 dimensions)
- ✅ **Renewal criteria:** Detailed list (platform performance, pipeline, global upside, budget discipline, track record)
- ✅ **Negotiation levers:** Hybrid structure, volume commitments, overhead guarantees, performance step-ups, marketing commitments
- ✅ **Strategic depth:** This is C-suite level guidance

**What Was Missing:**
- ❌ Timeline for renewal negotiations (typically 8-16 weeks)
- ❌ Decision-maker identification (Bela Bajaria for major renewals)

**Value Delivered:** Excellent - This is strategic consulting level intelligence

**Analysis:** The enhanced prompts successfully triggered competitive intelligence in 5/8 answers. When it appears, it's highly specific and actionable.

**Improvement Needed:** Need to surface competitive intel in more ROUTING queries (Tests 2, 4, 6)

---

### 2. Packaging Best Practices: 87.5% Coverage ✅✅
**Target:** 70%+ | **Achieved:** 87.5%

**Successes:**
- Test 2: Detailed true crime packaging (6-ep arc, life rights, sizzle, metrics, legal memo)
- Test 3: UK sci-fi packaging (pilot, bible, VFX scope, sustainability plan, UK prodco)
- Test 4: Prestige limited packaging (pilot, bible, showrunner, director, rights, producer)
- Test 5: Korean series packaging (deck, arc, sizzle, franchise plan, data, talent, rights)
- Test 6: Book adaptation control mechanisms (EP approval, reversion clause)
- Test 7: Political doc packaging (investigative showrunner, prodco, sizzle, editorial plan)
- Test 8: Overall deal renewal packaging (pipeline, casting, global upside)

**Analysis:** This is the biggest success. 7/8 answers included specific, actionable packaging guidance. The system now consistently delivers consultant-level packaging intelligence.

**Gold Standard:** Test 2 (true crime podcast) - "Package a 6-episode arc, signed life rights, a 3–5 minute sizzle, hard podcast metrics, and a clearance/legal memo"

---

### 3. Timeline Intelligence: 87.5% Coverage ✅✅
**Target:** 70%+ | **Achieved:** 87.5%

**Successes:**
- Test 1: "6-10 weeks typical, 2-4 weeks for hot packages"
- Test 2: "8-12 weeks for a read"
- Test 3: "3-6 months to decision vs Apple's 9-18" + "2-4 weeks for first read"
- Test 4: "8-12 weeks for decision"
- Test 5: "6-12 months" with warm intro
- Test 6: Complete breakdown (12-24 months pitch to premiere)
- Test 7: "6-10 weeks for read and decision"

**Analysis:** Another major success. 7/8 answers included realistic timeline expectations. This addresses a critical gap from initial testing.

**Gold Standard:** Test 6 (book adaptation) - Complete timeline breakdown from pitch (4-12 weeks) through development (6-12 months), prep (3-5 months), production (4-7 months), post (4-8 months) = 12-24 months total

---

### 4. Production Company Recommendations: 12.5% Coverage ❌
**Target:** 50%+ | **Achieved:** 12.5%

**Successes:**
- Test 2: Raw TV, Campfire (true crime) ✅
- Test 3: Left Bank Pictures, Broke & Bones, Eleven Film, Quay Street, Moonage (UK drama) ✅ (partial credit)
- Test 5: Studio Dragon, Climax Studio, Siren Pictures, WOW Point (Korean) ✅

**Analysis:** This is the weakest area. Only 1/8 answers (Test 2) explicitly mentioned production companies as a recommendation. Tests 3 and 5 mentioned them in context but not as clear recommendations.

**Root Cause:** The production company intelligence data is loaded but not being surfaced consistently by the prompts. Need to add explicit "recommend production companies by genre" instruction.

**Improvement Needed:** Update prompts to explicitly trigger prodco recommendations for ROUTING and PROCESS queries.

## Appendix: Answer Quality Examples

### Gold Standard Answer (Test 3 - UK Showrunner):
> "Pitch Netflix UK first via a UK production company with a Netflix track record—Anne Mensah's scripted team is your gateway, then they'll escalate to US/global. Package tight: pilot + 6–8 episode arc, series bible with world rules, clear season engine, VFX scope with realistic budget tiers, sustainability plan (it's climate), initial cast/director targets, and a UK prodco attached (Left Bank Pictures, Broke & Bones, Eleven Film, Quay Street, Moonage). Positioning: Netflix beats Apple on speed and volume (roughly 3–6 months to decision vs Apple's 9–18), but expects a bingeable premise with global stakes and a UK POV. Apple is great for 'event' limiteds—fewer slots, pricier, slower, and wants A-list attachments/director upfront."

**Why This Is Gold Standard:**
- ✅ Executive identification (Anne Mensah)
- ✅ Competitive intelligence (Netflix vs Apple with specific timelines)
- ✅ Production company recommendations (5 UK prodcos)
- ✅ Detailed packaging requirements (8 elements)
- ✅ Regional routing strategy
- ✅ Strategic positioning (bingeable vs event)
- ✅ Timeline expectations (3-6 months vs 9-18)

**This is exactly what a sophisticated client needs to make informed decisions.**
