Loaded 6 persona test scenarios
Testing first 3 questions per persona for speed


================================================================================
PERSONA 1: Established Showrunner with Limited Series
================================================================================
Background: Emmy-nominated showrunner with 2 successful cable dramas, now developing first Netflix project
Project: The Fixer - A political thriller limited series about a crisis management consultant navigating Washington DC scandals
Sophistication: advanced



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 1/3:
I have a political thriller limited series with an A-list lead attached. Who's the right Netflix executive to pitch this to, and what do they actually care about right now?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ SUCCESS (88.4s)

ANSWER:
Michael Azzolino is your person here. He’s co-driving Netflix’s prestige-limited push and is leaning hard into star-led, awards-aimed thrillers that feel urgent and globally resonant. Your political thriller, finite and A-list attached, fits that lane—he’ll zero in on a crisp 6–8 episode spine, an auteur plan (who’s directing all eps?), and a trailer-ready hook tied to today’s headlines. Proof point: the recent House of Guinness greenlight signals the bar—premium, buzzy, Emmy-minded. Have your rep lead with “Limited Series • A‑list attached • Awards play” and include a one-pager with episode map and talent window.

FOLLOW-UPS:
  • What are examples of successful thriller projects at Netflix?
  • What production companies work with Netflix?
  • What's the typical pitch process?

QUESTION 2/3:
What's Netflix's current appetite for political content? Should I position this as prestige limited series or something else?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

❌ FAILED (96.2s)
ERROR: Error calling GPT-5: GPT-5 request timed out


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 3/3:
I need to understand the pitch process - do I go through a production company first, or can I pitch directly? What's the actual pathway?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ SUCCESS (88.6s)

ANSWER:
Kennedy Corrin is your north star for drama at Netflix—she champions character-first series that travel. You won’t pitch her cold. The path is via a producer with a Netflix overall/first‑look or through your agent/manager; unsolicited submissions don’t get read. If it’s international, start regionally—UK docs, for example, route through Kate Townsend’s team before LA. In the UK doc lane, tight 2–3 minute sizzles with a sharp logline have been winning quick reads. Position this by securing a Netflix‑friendly producer to host the first meeting and bring it inside.

================================================================================
PERSONA 2: A-List Actor with Production Company
================================================================================
Background: Oscar-nominated actor with established production company, has overall deal at another streamer expiring soon
Project: Untitled True Crime Anthology - Each season explores a different unsolved American mystery with A-list talent rotating as leads
Sophistication: advanced



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 1/3:
My overall deal is expiring and I'm considering Netflix. Who should I be talking to about a high-end true crime anthology series?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ SUCCESS (46.3s)

ANSWER:
The most reliable path is through a production company with an active Netflix deal—aim Scripted Drama (Kennedy Corrin’s team) if it’s a scripted anthology, or the Unscripted/Doc Series group if it’s docu. Package it: lock life rights/source IP, attach a marquee showrunner/director, and build a deck around global appeal, binge-ability, and franchise legs. Lead with a killer S1 case and a clear seasons roadmap; cite Monster as a comp but differentiate your POV/access. Don’t cold pitch without rights. Expect a high bar—Netflix buys ~1–2 true-crime series/year and deliberations can take 8–12+ weeks. Success = a pre-packaged, rights-secured, franchise-ready pitch via a trusted Netflix partner.

FOLLOW-UPS:
  • What materials do I need for a pitch?
  • How long does the pitch process typically take?
  • What are common reasons pitches get rejected?

EVALUATION:
  Score: 1/5 (20%)
  Matched criteria:
    ✓ Explains Netflix's true crime strategy evolution


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 2/3:
What's the competitive landscape? I know I can get this set up elsewhere, but what makes Netflix the right home for this specific project?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ SUCCESS (48.0s)

ANSWER:
Brandon Riegg is your edge here. He’s been driving Netflix’s big-format wave—think Squid Game: The Challenge and Physical: 100—chasing concepts that spark worldwide, day-and-date conversation. Competitors can mount a season; Netflix can turn your format into a franchise with simultaneous global rollout, social heat, and local versions that feed back into the mothership. They’re making fewer, bigger bets, so when they commit, you feel it. Tip: open with your international spin-off plan and social mechanics; flag any rights you want to retain—worldwide exclusivity is the norm but negotiable.

EVALUATION:
  Score: 2/5 (40%)
  Matched criteria:
    ✓ Provides strategic positioning vs competitors
    ✓ Maps internal approval process for big-budget projects
